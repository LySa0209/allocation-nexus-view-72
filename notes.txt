Notes for next steps:

In available consultants
    better graphics
    DONE bottom left box, maximum height increases with height of the box on the right
    add match score visual --> add score to api return and also in order of core flagged first
    add the core/non core flag/colour like when selected


Ensure when a project already has allocated consultants, when selected it should display it
New api:
    to confirm and commit the allocation


In the list of projects, order them according to starting date, win prob, importance.
